      <p>Day and Night</p>
      <h1>Statement</h1>
    </div>
    
    <p> There are 24 hours in a day. An average day on earth is 12 hours of daytime adn 12 hours fo night time. During this time everything on earth transtion in their own way.</p>
      
      <p>For these pages I tried to show how night time effects the city and the forest. On the first page when the tree is clicked it take you to the forest. In the forest when night time comes the inhabbitants of the forest react differently that those living in the city. On the forest page when the cursor is hovered over the moon it shows how the wolf living in the forest gets ready to howl.</p>

    <p>When the car on the home page is clicked it takes you to the city page. When in the city when nightfall comes the inhabbitants react accordingly. There is a lightbulb on the tip right of the page. When the cursor is  hovered over this light bulb the city lights turn on. This the reaction of the city to nightitme.</p>
